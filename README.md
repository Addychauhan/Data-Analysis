# Student Placement Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the placement package of a student based on their CGPA
using Machine Learning. A Linear Regression model is trained on historical
placement data and integrated with a Tkinter-based desktop application
for real-time predictions

## 🎯 Objective
To build an end-to-end system that:
- Analyzes student placement data
- Predicts expected salary packages based on CGPA
- Provides a simple GUI for user interaction

## 📊 Dataset
- Feature: `updated_placement.csv`
- Target: Placement Package (LPA)
- Total Records: 200

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Tkinter
- Joblib

## 🔍 Steps Performed
- Data Loading and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation using R² Score
- Package Prediction
- Saving the trained model
- Building a Tkinter GUI for predictions 

## 📈 Model Used
- Algorithm: Linear Regression
- Evaluation Metric: R² Score
- The model learns the relationship between CGPA and placement package.

## ✅ Result
The model shows a strong relationship between CGPA and placement package
and performs well on unseen data.

## 🖥️ Tkinter GUI Application
A desktop application built using Tkinter where users can:
- Enter CGPA
- Click on Check Package
- View the predicted placement package instantly
-
