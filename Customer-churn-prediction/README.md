##🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction

**📌 Project Overview**
Customer churn is a major concern for banks, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
This project focuses on predicting whether a bank customer is likely to churn (leave the bank) using machine learning techniques based on customer demographic and financial data.

**🎯 Objective**
To analyze customer behavior and identify factors influencing churn
To build a machine learning model that predicts customer churn accurately
To evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics

**📊 Dataset Description**
The dataset contains customer-level information such as:
Customer demographics (age, gender, geography)
Financial details (balance, estimated salary)
Account information (credit score, tenure, number of products)
Target variable: Churn (Exited / Not Exited)

**🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Analyzed churn distribution across different features
Identified patterns related to age, balance, geography, and tenure
Visualized relationships using bar plots, histograms, and count plots
Checked class imbalance in churned vs non-churned customers

**🧹 Data Preprocessing**
Handled missing and inconsistent values
Encoded categorical variables
Applied feature scaling where required
Split data into training and testing sets

**🤖 Model Building**
Implemented Logistic Regression for churn prediction
Trained the model on preprocessed data
Focused on interpretability and baseline performance

📈 **Model Evaluation**
Evaluated the model using multiple metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Confusion Matrix
ROC-AUC Score
Special attention was given to recall, as identifying churn-prone customers is critical in business scenarios.
